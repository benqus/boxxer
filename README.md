Boxxer - Frame manager
=======================

Boxxer is an experiment to replace webcentric without the CSS3 box layout but similar to it.

Note: install QuickPHP (you might not want to shoot with a cannon [Apache|etc...] for a tiny birdy...) to
test the asynchronous Box persistence

# Grunt build

Node with npm required.
Use npm to install grunt and then just run ```npm install``` inside the root directory.
Then just run ```grunt``` to build a new minified version.

If adding file make sure to update the Gruntfile.js!
